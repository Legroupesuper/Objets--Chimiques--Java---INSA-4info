/**
 * This annotation permits to indicate that the computeSelect() method will not be used in the reaction.
 * It is equivalent to returning true in a computeSelect() method where no particular preconditions are 
 * required for the reaction to process.<br/>
 * The main goal of this annotation is to speed up the execution of the reaction by skipping the selection process.
